We are pulling from a csv file of US collegiate statistics.  The file had plenty of extra data we narrowed down to show certain correllations.

###Reproducing Our Work:
1. Create a GitHub repository for the project.
2. Create the folders for your project.
3. Find a csv file for statistical comparisons.
4. Make the data tables in SQL Developer.
5. Build an html file to document these steps.


Use this html file to present a visual story about your data and what you discovered about your data using visualization techniques.
